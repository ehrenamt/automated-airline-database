# Automated Airline Scheduling DB & API

> An automated, self-contained, and secure trip scheduling database and API meant to replicate real-world airline databases. 

# Description

This projects automates creating upcoming trips and archiving past and cancelled trips, while securely separating user priveleges. It is designed to be as contained as possible within a PostgreSQL instance. No business logic or query logic is needed in a backend server.

This means that the backend simply queries while the database self-manages.

# Installation and Setup

This is a work-in-progress and I will update this once completed.
