# Automated Airline Scheduling DB & API

> An automated, self-contained, and secure trip scheduling database and API meant to replicate real-world airline databases. 

# Overview

Airlines require complex algorithms and systems to manage their aircraft, their flights, and their trips. This projects aims to automate as much of the trip scheduling, aircraft assignment, and trip updates as possible in a single PostgreSQL database. PostgreSQL offers all the necessary features (functions, triggers, crontabs, and strict securty permissions) to automate these tasks in a secure manner.

No business logic or query logic is needed in a backend server. This means that the backend simply queries while the database self-manages.

# Database Design

The database design statements are located in the ```init.sql``` (defining user permissions and schemas) and ```schema.sql``` (defining tables, entities, and functions ++). This section will go over the entities, tables, views, and user permissions defined in this database. Then it will briefly go over the functions that automate this database.
