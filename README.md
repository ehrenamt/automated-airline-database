> An automated, self-contained, and secure trip scheduling database and API meant to replicate real-world airline databases. 

# Overview

Airlines require complex algorithms and systems to manage their aircraft, their flights, and their trips. This projects aims to automate as much of the trip scheduling, aircraft assignment, and trip updates as possible in a single PostgreSQL database. PostgreSQL offers all the necessary features (functions, triggers, crontabs, and strict securty permissions) to automate these tasks in a secure manner.

No business logic or query logic is needed in a backend server. This means that the backend simply queries while the database self-manages.

# Installation and Setup

Each of the three services are dockerized and are built together with ```docker compose```. They are designed to work on the same host.

# Sample Usage

This is a work-in-progress and I will update this once completed.
